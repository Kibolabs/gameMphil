This is a router, It checks for the packet destination address and routes the packet to a closent interface
The router got your Packet Information, Destination is on a network linked to this router.
The destination address is on interface 127.2.2.2/4
Exit to that interface to Deliver the Packet
A synchronization was sent to the destination host.
GoodLuck.
